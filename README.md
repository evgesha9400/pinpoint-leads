# Pinpoint Leads

## Business Overview
- Pinpoint Leads is a B2B lead generation service that transforms excess ZoomInfo capacity into hyper-targeted contact lists.
- The service specializes in drive-time geographic precision rather than arbitrary ZIP code or radius-based targeting.
- We can target any B2B sector; our current scoring is tuned for healthcare decision-makers.
- Delivery time is 3-5 business days with pricing at £2-£3 per qualified lead.
- The service uses a proprietary job title scoring algorithm that evaluates 400+ role patterns to prioritize decision-makers.
- For best results, clients can provide job title keyword categories (hard includes, hard excludes) and scoring weights; we plug these directly into our scoring system.
- Enhanced ZoomInfo API access provides data fields unavailable through the standard web interface.
- We combine Clay’s multi-provider enrichment (100+ integrations) with enterprise ZoomInfo coverage. Some contacts are unique to each source, some overlap—merging them yields the most complete set.
- This is an AI+human GTM solution: proprietary processing, intelligent job-title scoring aligned iteratively to each client’s ICP, plus hands-on human oversight for quality.
- Drive-time filtering is a differentiator, but the primary value is the completeness and quality of data from multi-source enrichment and proprietary processing.
- Designed as a GTM (go-to-market) strategy for territory-based prospecting and pipeline generation.
- Target customers are B2B sales teams wasting resources on geographically unreachable or unqualified prospects.

## Core Value Propositions
- Combine Clay + ZoomInfo for maximum coverage; deduplicate, union, and score to deliver the most complete, CRM-ready dataset.
- Iteratively refine ICP-aligned job-title scoring (client-provided includes/excludes and weights) with human QA.
- Define service areas by actual driving time accounting for traffic patterns and geographic barriers.
- Eliminate leads outside realistic sales territory reach to optimize team efficiency.
- Automatically prioritize C-suite, VP, and Director-level contacts while filtering out non-decision makers.
- Access deeper prospect insights than competitors can provide through standard tools.
- Provide clean, scored, CRM-ready CSV files with verified contact information.
- Offer transparent pricing with no subscriptions, hidden fees, or minimums.
- Double SDR productivity by replacing manual list-building (often >50% of SDR time) with higher-quality, geo-qualified leads.

### Problem Section
- Highlight four core problems with traditional lead generation approaches.
- Show that geographic targeting is often wrong with leads outside service areas.
- Explain that contact selection misses actual decision-makers at target companies.
- Demonstrate that data is often incomplete without engagement metrics or verified phones.
- Show that single-source approaches miss coverage: some contacts exist in Clay but not ZoomInfo and vice versa; overlap exists, so merging is required for completeness.
- Illustrate how sales resources are wasted on unqualified prospects.

### Solution Section
- Present three main feature cards explaining the service's unique capabilities.
- Detail drive-time geographic precision with customizable time zones.
- Describe intelligent contact prioritization using the scoring algorithm.
- Showcase combined multi-source enrichment via Clay (100+ integrations) and enhanced ZoomInfo data fields, clearly labeling what comes from each.
- Emphasize AI + human QA in scoring and enrichment for outcome quality.

### How It Works Section
- Break down the five-step process using expandable accordion sections.
- Explain territory definition based on drive-time boundaries.
- Describe company identification within accessible service areas.

### Case Studies Section
